# Advent Of Code 2024 In Deno

I used aoc 2024 as an excuse to mess around with Deno.

Most of these solutions can be invoked by changing into the appropriate directory and running:
```
deno --allow-read main.ts ./input.txt
```
Some solutions require more than one input and are read in as positional arguments like so:
```
deno --allow-read main.ts ./input-01.txt ./input-02.txt
```
## Disclaimer

I'm not a great programmer and I didn't lean on AI/LLM solutions for these to keep things as human-centric as possible.
